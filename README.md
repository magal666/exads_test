# exads_test

This is my test about the interview.
I didn't use Docker because I don't have familiarity to create the DockerFile (yet) and
if I would need to study now for that, I probably wouldn't deliver the test, 
I didn`t have many time, because of my work.
I didn't use framework either, I did everything in vanilla PHP
